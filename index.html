                <p>Pancho was a black lab mix that we met in August 2020. He was picked up as a stray near Lufkin in
                    East Texas and ended up with the <a href="https://www.dfwlabrescue.org/" target="_blank">DFW Lab
                        Rescue</a>. He was 32
                    lbs with an eye infection, ear infection, and several other issues. He went to a foster family that
                    nurtured him up to 40 lbs and that’s when we met him.

                <p>Upon meeting Pancho, we knew right away that we were supposed to love him forever. At first, he was
                    scared of everything and everyone. We knew this was from having a tough life before us and we vowed
                    to never let him suffer again. Over the next few months, we built up his confidence and his body.
                    Pancho became strong, confident, and incredibly happy.
                </p>
                <p>Pancho loved playing fetch and was very good at it. He was an excellent swimmer and he was obsessed
                    with stalking squirrels. He loved every dog he ever met. He proudly walked around the parks of
                    Turtle Creek in Dallas. After a short while, everyone seemed to know Pancho.</p>

                    description of “ASSAULT CAUSES BODILY INJURY TO A FAMILY MEMBER”</li>
                <li>A Class A Misdemeanor is “ considered the most serious type of misdemeanor in Texas.”</li>

                <li>At the time of the incident, K9 Cabin Dallas had been in business for less than 6 months.</li>
                <li>There are home security cameras in the front and back of Wendy and Michael’s house.

            <ul>
                <li>Wendy Strawser picked up Pancho from our home around 9 AM on May 27th.
                </li>
                <li>Pancho arrived at Wendy Strawser’s home on May 27th at 9:23 AM.</li>
                <li>Pancho DID NOT go on any walks that day.
                </li>
                <li>Pancho did not “slip his collar and run away” during a walk.</li>
                <li>Wendy Strawser and Michael Hamill did not EVER leave their home to search for
                    Pancho, prior to us arriving at their home.</li>
                <li>During the time Pancho was allegedly missing, no shelters were called by Wendy and
                    Michael. Dallas Animal Services was not called. Nearby veterinarians were not called.
                </li>
                <li>No flyers, signs, or social media posts were put out by Wendy Strawser and Michael
                    Hamill on the day Pancho went missing.</li>
                <li>Michael leaves at 3:30 after appearing to put something in his pickup truck. He drives
                    towards Merrifield Road, a well known illegal dumping area. Less than five minutes later,
                    he pulls back into his driveway.

    <div class="message">
        <p>We were fortunate to obtain security video footage from several of Wendy Strawser’s neighbors.
            We have video showing her house for the entire day of May 27th, 2021. For transparency, we
            have uploaded all of these videos to Youtube. There is well over 20 hours of video. Please feel
            free to watch these videos for yourself.</p>
        <p>Using these videos, we compiled a timeline that describes the day that Pancho mysteriously
            disappeared. We also selected the most important clips and created a single video that tells the
            story of that day. You can watch that video <a href="#mainVideo">here</a>.</p>

                            <strong>Michael Hamill</strong> and <strong>Wendy Strawser</strong>, they were “searching
                            for him the whole
                            time”. However, video evidence shows that they never left their house during
                            this time. Their vehicles stay in the same place and they do not leave their
                            house at all.

                            Instagram with the other dogs. Pancho is in no pictures or videos from that
                            day, even before the alleged time when he “got off the leash” during a walk.

        </div>
        <div id="resourceBody">
            <h3><strong>Considering boarding your dog or using a dog daycare business? Here are some things to
                consider. We cannot stress enough, DO NOT EVER leave your dog with a business or person
                without 24/7 live cameras that you have complete access to through an app or website.</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Below are some other things to consider:</strong></p>
            <h3><strong>Service Agreement</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The business should have an agreement that outlines what services you can expect.</li>
                <li>It will outline what you and your dog are required to do. It should also outline what the
                    business can and cannot do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If anything seems questionable, speak up and clear it up with the business
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you aren’t happy with the agreement terms, just move on to another business.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It should include something along the lines of, “if my dog is lost, injured, or involved with
                    any other irregular occurrence, I will be notified immediately”
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the above statement is not included, request for it to be added.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Cameras</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>They must have video cameras that show every part of the facility where your dog will be.
                </li>
                <li>These cameras should be accessible to you and other dog parents, 24/7.
                </li>
                <li>These cameras should have a record feature, with video backup of at least 7 days.
                </li>
                <li>Camera footage should never be deleted prior to the normal deletion schedule.</li>
                <li>If a business does not have cameras, simply move on. DO NOT listen to any excuse or
                    reason why they don’t have cameras. Cameras are cheap and easy to use, there is no
                    excuse.
                </li>
                <li>The only reason why a business like this would not want cameras is to remove liability
                    and accountability. Cameras are the first requirement.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>Staff</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ask for a run down of who will be working and/or present anytime your dog is on site.
                </li>
                <li>Try to meet everyone and give them an initial “gut check”. Do they seem like good
                    people? Trustworthy people? All of them?
                </li>
                <li>Believe it or not, not all “dog people” are actually good people.
                </li>
                <li>Ideally, background check everyone. Watching dogs is often a lower paying job and
                    many businesses do not background check their own staff. Do it for them. As we found
                    out, we had unknowingly hired someone (Wendy Strawser) with a criminal background
                    (assault charges) to watch our dog. Violent people are violent people. Why trust your
                    dog with someone that has assaulted people? There are too many other options, just
                    move on.
                </li>
                <li>If you are using a business for an extended period of time, routinely check on new staff,
                    ask questions about management. Does the business seem stable? Is there a lot of staff
                    turnover?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><strong>GPS Tracking</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Get a GPS collar and put it on your dog. Always and forever. Pay the small monthly fee.</li>
                <li>Do not ever remove this collar.</li>
                <li>Instruct the business (or anyone watching your dog) to NEVER remove this collar.</li>
                <li>Amend your service agreement with the business to require that this collar is never
                    removed from your dog.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="searchBody">
                <h3><strong>The Search</strong></h3>
                <p>The search for Pancho was an emotionally and physically exhausting experience. While
                    searching for a lost dog, it is easy to panic and overlook certain areas or forget to do certain
                    things. Very few people are experienced at searching for a lost dog. This was a new experience
                    for us. Because of this, I logged most of our activities during the search. Below is a summary of
                    the search for Pancho during the time period of May 27th - June 1st, 2021.</p>
                <h4>Thursday, May 17th, 2021</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>3:52 PM - Arrived at Wendy Starwsers home 18 minutes after receiving the call from
                        Michael Hamill.
                        </li>
                    <li>3:53 PM - Started by talking with Michael in person at his home. Wendy wasn’t home at
                        the time. We were surprised at how casual they were about the whole thing. Michael
                        wasn’t searching when we arrived and only left his house after we got upset and begged
                        for help. Despite claiming that he had been searching for four hours, we later found out
                        that was a lie.
                        </li>
                    <li>3:53 PM - 9:00 PM - Maria and I searched the neighborhood and the nearby wooded
                        area. Due to the recent rains, the wooded area was very muddy and difficult to navigate.
                        I walked the creek in both directions, about half a mile each way.
                        </li>
                    <li>During this time, I called my Mom and had her quickly print and bring us flyers. We
                        started with 100 or so, but ended up handing out over 1,200 flyers during our search.
                        </li>
                    <li>We also called my Dad and had him start printing yard signs. We started with 30 signs
                        but eventually had 120 signs in yards and posted on every stop sign and traffic light
                        within a 3-4 mile radius.
                        </li>
                    <li>Also during this time, my Mom went to Dallas Animal Services to check in person for
                        Pancho. This allowed us to keep searching in the neighborhood.</li>
                    <li>At 9:15PM, a very good friend and firefighter, Steve, showed up with his ATV and
                        outdoor gear to search the woods. The wooded area is very rough terrain, muddy, and a
                        known area for crime. Around midnight, we accidentally flipped over the ATV on a muddy
                        slope. Luckily, nobody was hurt and we were able to wench the ATV upright. We parked
                        it and went the rest of the way on foot.</li>
                    <li>We walked the muddy trails for a few miles into the woods, desperately calling out for
                        Pancho. With storms in the distance, we knew we had to get back before the rain started
                        and made the trails impossible to walk.</li>
                    <li>We got the ATV out of the woods and drove around the neighborhood and school until
                        4AM. Some teenagers playing basketball (at 3AM….) told us they saw a black dog near
                        the apartment complex across the street. Steve headed home and Maria and I sat in my
                        car in the teacher’s parking lot at Nancy J Cochran Elementary School until sun up. We
                        didn’t sleep or eat. We just watched the nearby apartment complex, hoping that Pancho
                        would show up.
                        </li>
                    <li>Several times throughout the night, I would get out of the car and walk around the
                        apartments to see if Pancho was hiding in the area.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Friday, May 28th, 2021</strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Around 7AM, the school employees started showing up and we got out of our car to ask
                        them if they had seen Pancho around the school the day before. One man thought he
                        had seen Pancho but it turned out to be a Rottweiler that we had also seen around the
                        same area the day before. (A few days later, for confirmation, we found a neighbor with a
                        camera facing the school. Pancho never ran down the road into the woods, as told to us
                        by Wendy and Michael).
                        </li>
                    <li>After talking with several school staff, we drove through the apartment complex. We
                        talked to anyone and everyone that we saw. Nobody had seen Pancho.
                        </li>
                    <li>We continued our search throughout the neighborhood. Checking every street, alley,
                        backyards, and behind every gas station, shop, etc.
                        </li>
                    <li>Friends showed up to help us hand out flyers and go door-to-door. We had printed more
                        flyers and delivered around 500 flyers to the houses and apartments in the area.
                        </li>
                    <li>We stayed in the area until 9PM Friday. Exhausted, muddy, starving, and heart broken,
                        we returned to our home after nearly 30 straight hours searching for Pancho. After the
                        initial 30 minute search by Michael (after we begged for his help), Wendy and Michael
                        were never seen searching for Pancho again.
                        </li>
                    <li>Once home, we couldn’t really sleep. So we continued checking shelter websites,
                        craigslist, Nextdoor, Facebook, and anything else we could find that might have a clue.
                        We paid for several “online dog detective” services as well, hoping that more people
                        looking online would increase the chances of finding Pancho.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Saturday, May 29th, 2021</strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>9:30AM - I had a two hour phone call with professional dog tracker Bonnie Hale. We had
                        contacted her and a few other trackers but due to scheduling, couldn’t get anybody on
                        site until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest.
                        </li>
                    <li>Instead, I paid Bonnie for a consultation to learn everything that she knew about tracking
                        and luring a dog that has run away. The only issue was that Pancho never ran away but
                        we didn’t find that out for a few more days.
                        </li>
                    <li>During this time, we had around ten friends and family members searching the
                        neighborhood where Pancho allegedly ran away. Their help allowed us to get some rest,
                        eat a little bit, and continue gathering resources.</li>
                    <li>11:30AM - We drove to Dallas Animal Services and looked for Pancho. Meanwhile, my
                        Dad checked Traders Village to see if Pancho was for sale (someone tipped us off that
                        sometimes lost dogs end up there to be sold as pets). He also went to several other area
                        shelters, hoping he showed up somewhere.</li>
                    <li>After checking DAS, we were back in the neighborhood, driving roads, alleys, and
                        scouring the woods.</li>
                    <li>We had a friend translate all of our flyers and signs into Spanish. We printed 1,000 more
                        and got to work handing them out. Three college aged guys that we know showed up
                        and literally jogged from house to house passing out flyers. This helped us cover the
                        area quickly and by the end of Saturday, there wasn’t a house in that neighborhood that
                        didn’t have at least one flyer from us.
                        </li>
                    <li>While the younger guys ran around with flyers, Maria went door to door talking to people.
                        I drove around, placing and hanging yard signs and bright green/yellow poster signs.
                        There wasn’t an intersection within a 3 mile radius that didn’t have our signs clearly
                        posted.
                        </li>
                    <li>A neighbor in the area got our flyer and called to help. He was a licensed drone pilot and
                        offered to fly over the area, looking for Pancho. We gladly accepted his offer and he
                        continued helping for several days.
                        </li>
                    <li>More friends and family searched the area with us, overlapping each other and leaving
                        no alley, street, or backyard unchecked.
                        </li>
                    <li>Saturday night, we decided to try one of the dog tracker tips. She told us to slowly grill
                        meat in the area where we think Pancho might be. Our best guess was that he ran into
                        the woods as Wendy and Michael had told us (a big lie). With the help of our friend
                        Steve, we went back into the woods, hiked up a small hill, set up a grill, and started
                        cooking.
                        </li>
                    <li>We cooked meat from about 9PM until 4am. We were okay with the mosquitoes, the
                        scorpion that almost stung Maria’s hand, and even the random group of off-roaders that
                        came through the area around 12:30am. But when we started hearing gunfire in the
                        distance, followed by bullets landing in the nearby bushes, we decided it was time to
                        leave. 7 hours of grilling meat and no sign of Pancho.
                        </li>
                    <li>We drove the area a few more times before going home at 5am.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Sunday, May 30th, 2021</strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Around 10am, we headed back to DAS to look for Pancho. We prayed that he would
                        show up at a shelter, but no luck. Aside from us checking online constantly, we had
                        friends, family, and paid services looking for him as well.
                        </li>
                    <li>We headed back to the neighborhood, exhausted and very concerned by this point.
                        Nobody had seen Pancho. Wendy and Michael weren’t searching. Their story seemed to
                        make less and less sense.
                        </li>
                    <li>After another full day of searching, I decided to call Michael asking for a video (from his
                        Ring Doorbell Camera) showing exactly what time Pancho left on the walk. If we could
                        just see video of Pancho leaving their house and not returning, we could believe their
                        story and continue searching for Pancho, possibly forever. But Michael didn’t answer, so
                        I texted. No Reply. Maria called Wendy and texted as well, no reply.
                        </li>
                    <li>The people that “lost” our dog, were now blocking our calls. Very strange behavior. At
                        this point, it was dark and we were exhausted, so we headed home confused and upset.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Monday, May 31st, 2021 - Memorial Day</strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monday morning, Memorial Day, we headed back to the area. I was determined to
                        search the woods again even though it was raining quite a bit. Also, due to their strange
                        behavior, we decided to call the police to ask for help in viewing the video of Pancho
                        leaving.
                        </li>
                    <li>The police showed up and were empathetic to our story. They knocked on the door and
                        Michael came outside. He was defensive, rude, and refused to show any video. We
                        explained that if we could see the video, we would never contact him again. He still
                        refused.</li>
                    <li>Wendy and Michael have cameras in their front and back yards. They refused to show
                        us, the police and later the detective, the footage captured by these cameras.
                        </li>
                    <li>After meeting with Michael, the police officers pulled us aside and told us that something
                        “was off” and that Michael appeared to be lying. More importantly, they told us that
                        Michael seemed to be talking about Pancho “as if he is gone”. They suggested that we
                        stop looking for Pancho and start looking for evidence of a crime.</li>
                    <li>We spent the remainder of the day knocking on every door in the neighborhood that had
                        a camera outside.</li>
                    <li>We downloaded every video possible and returned home to review.</li>
                    <li>Within 30 minutes of watching video from around the neighborhood, we knew Wendy
                        Strawser and Michael Hamill were lying. Pancho never went on a walk. He never ran
                        away. And they never search for him.
                        </li>
                    <li>While reviewing the footage of the day Pancho disappeared, we saw Michael appear to
                        put something into his pickup truck. It was a few minutes after he had called us to inform
                        us that Pancho was missing.
                        </li>
                    <li>After appearing to put something in his truck, Michael then drives towards a nearby
                        illegal dumping area and returns home less than five minutes later.</li>
                    <li>With the new evidence, I contacted the dog tracker and asked her to come out Tuesday
                        to look for Pancho’s body on that road.
                        </li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>Tuesday, June 1st, 2021</strong></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>We spent the morning reviewing more video footage and compiling the more important
                        video clips.
                        </li>
                    <li>12PM - We met dog tracker Bonnie Hale at the elementary school and headed to the
                        dumping ground.</li>
                    <li>We timed Michael’s 4 minute and 30 second drive to see how far he could have gone,
                        marking the road each direction so that the dog could track the entire area.</li>
                    <li>While the dog tracker worked with the dog, we went along the road and opened every
                        visible trash bag, box, etc.
                        </li>
                    <li>I won’t even begin to describe the things that we encountered while digging through the
                        trash in this area</li>
                    <li>The dog tracker and her tracking dog worked along Merrifield Rd for 3-4 hours. The dog
                        did pick up some scent that may have been Pancho, but no physical evidence could be
                        found.</li>
                    <li>At this point, it had been 5 days since Pancho disappeared. If his body had been left in
                        this area, it was likely moved once they realized how determined we were to find
                        Pancho.</li>
