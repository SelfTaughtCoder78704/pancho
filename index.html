                <p>Pancho was a black lab mix that we met in August 2020. He was picked up as a stray near Lufkin in
                    East Texas and ended up with the <a href="https://www.dfwlabrescue.org/"
                        target="_blank">DFW Lab Rescue</a>. He was 32
                    lbs with an eye infection, ear infection, and several other issues. He went to a foster family that
                    nurtured him up to 40 lbs and that’s when we met him.

                <p>Upon meeting Pancho, we knew right away that we were supposed to love him forever. At first, he was
                    scared of everything and everyone. We knew this was from having a tough life before us and we vowed
                    to never let him suffer again. Over the next few months, we built up his confidence and his body.
                    Pancho became strong, confident, and incredibly happy.
                </p>
                <p>Pancho loved playing fetch and was very good at it. He was an excellent swimmer and he was obsessed
                    with stalking squirrels. He loved every dog he ever met. He proudly walked around the parks of
                    Turtle Creek in Dallas. After a short while, everyone seemed to know Pancho.</p>

                            <strong>Michael Hamill</strong> and <strong>Wendy Strawser</strong>, they were “searching for him the whole
                            time”. However, as you can see from the videos, they never left their home. Their
                            vehicles stay in the same place and nobody leaves the house. Not even for one
                            minute.</p>

                            Wendy and Michael can both be seen on Instagram with the other dogs. Pancho
                            is in no pictures or videos from that day, even before the alleged time when he
                            “got off the leash” during a walk.</p>

        <div class="factsBody">
            <ul>
                <li>Wendy's Criminal Record</li>
                <li>Wendy Strawser has a criminal background, with multiple assault charges</li>
                <li>Michael Hamill has no prior experience training or caring for dogs</li>
                <li>Michael called us at 3:30PM, telling us that Pancho had been missing since approximately 11:30AM.
                    Even though we now know this was a lie, why would anyone trust their dogs with someone that thought
                    it was okay to wait four hours to tell us this horrible news?</li>
                <li>Wendy and Michael have stated to us, on social media, and to the Dallas Police that Pancho “escaped
                    from his leash and darted to the woods” - This is a confirmed lie. Watch the videos.</li>
                <li>Wendy and Michael have also stated that they spent the entire day searching for Pancho. This is a
                    lie. We have videos from multiple angles showing their house for the entire day. They never left to
                    search for Pancho. Why would they? Pancho was never missing.</li>
                <li>Pancho arrived at their home on May 27th at 9:23</li>
                <li>Pancho DID NOT go on any walks that day, therefore he did not “slip his collar” and run away during
                    a walk.</li>
                <li>Michael does leave at 3:30 after putting something in his pickup truck. He drives towards Merrifield
                    Lane, a well known illegal dumping area. Less than five minutes later, he pulls back into his
                    driveway.</li>
